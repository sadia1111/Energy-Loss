Calculation of Energy Loss of Rebar during Elongation by Numerical Methods


This project is about calculating the energy lost by extending a piece of rebar by machine, as measured by the amount of force applied at each elongation 
of the machine.The data set is in the excel fine "'projectData3.xlsx".In the code file the data is fit with linear least squares, quadratic least squares, 
and cubic splines models. The model equations were then integrated to determine the amount of energy lost during elongation.
Results from these models were then compared with the traditional method of calculation, Hookeâ€™s Law.
